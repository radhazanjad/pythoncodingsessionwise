# Multi Words Variable Names
#
# Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
#
# There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

# Camel Case:    Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

myVariableName = "John"

# Pascal Case:  Each word starts with a capital letter:

MyVariableName = "John"

# Snake Case:   Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_variable_name = "John"
